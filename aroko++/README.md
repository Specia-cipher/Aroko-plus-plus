🛡️ Aroko++ — Heritage-Driven Hybrid Encryption CLI

Aroko++ is a cross-platform CLI tool blending cutting-edge cryptography with symbolic messaging inspired by Yoruba culture. It’s a security tool with a soul: built for confidentiality, integrity, and meaning.

✅ Achievements So Far

Core cryptography engine: AES-GCM for authenticated encryption; RSA/ECC for key management.

Command-line interface (CLI): Fully functional with keygen, encrypt, decrypt, scrub, delete, aroko, and extract-aroko.

Symbolic messaging layer: Optional embedding of human-readable “Aroko” signals alongside ciphertext.

Metadata scrubbing & secure deletion: Basic file hygiene implemented.

Progress feedback: Optional progress bars for large files.

Cross-platform readiness: Runs under Python virtual environments; future packaging for binaries and Docker planned.

Private key handling & CLI UX: Encrypted key detection, passphrase prompts, graceful error handling, and rich console feedback fully implemented.

🕒 Full Project Roadmap
